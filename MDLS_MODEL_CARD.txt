METABOLIC DYSREGULATION LATENT SCORE (MDLS) - MODEL CARD
========================================================

1. MODEL OVERVIEW
-----------------
The MDLS is a continuous latent score that captures cardiometabolic dysregulation.
It is designed for population surveillance and longitudinal monitoring. Kidney and
liver burdens (CREAT, FIB-4) are treated as comorbidity channels and reported
alongside the core cardiometabolic signal; a combined score applies small weights
to avoid domination.

Two models are provided:
- Model A (PCA-MDLS): Transparent, interpretable baseline using first principal component
- Model B (AE-MDLS): Nonlinear temporal autoencoder capturing longitudinal patterns

2. DATA USED
------------
- Source: Laboratory Information System (LIS) biomarker data
- Time period: 2022-01-01 to 2024-12-31
- Window size: 90 days
- Features: 9 biomarkers + 4 derived ratios
  * Core biomarkers: GLU, HBA1C, LDL, HDL, VLDL, TG, PLT, HGB
  * Derived: TG_HDL_RATIO, AST_ALT_RATIO, NON_HDL
  * Comorbidity channels: CREAT (kidney), FIB-4 (liver fibrosis score)
- Robust scaling: Applied using median/IQR from training set only
- Train/Val/Test split: 70/15/15 by patient (no temporal leakage)

3. MODEL ARCHITECTURE
---------------------
Model A (PCA):
- Method: Principal Component Analysis on core cardiometabolic features
- Components: First principal component (PC1)
- Explained variance (core): 58.69%
- Sign orientation: Higher MDLS = worse metabolic profile
- Combined score: MDLS_COMBINED = MDLS_PCA_CORE + 0.15*kidney_burden + 0.15*liver_burden

Model B (Temporal Autoencoder):
- Architecture: LSTM-based encoder-decoder
- Hidden dimension: 64
- Latent dimension: 32
- Layers: 2
- Training: Masked MSE reconstruction loss
- Normalization: Robust (median/IQR) on training set
- Inputs: Core cardiometabolic features; kidney/liver burdens reported separately

4. ASSUMPTIONS
--------------
- Biomarker measurements are representative of metabolic state
- Missing data patterns are missing at random (MAR)
- Temporal windows (90 days) capture relevant metabolic dynamics
- Robust scaling provides appropriate normalization across biomarkers

5. LIMITATIONS
--------------
- No external validation with clinical outcomes
- Missing data handled via masking (no imputation)
- Score interpretation requires clinical context
- Not validated for diagnostic purposes
- Population-specific (trained on specific LIS data)

6. INTENDED USE
---------------
- Population health surveillance
- Longitudinal monitoring of metabolic trajectories
- Identifying patients with worsening metabolic coherence
- Research and epidemiological studies
- Quality improvement initiatives

7. NON-INTENDED USE
------------------
- Diagnostic purposes
- Individual patient risk prediction
- Treatment decisions
- Replacing clinical judgment
- Use outside trained population

8. VALIDATION METRICS
---------------------
- PCA-AE Agreement (Spearman ρ, core): 0.034
- Correlations with key biomarkers (core):
  * HBA1C: PCA ρ = 0.753, AE ρ = 0.346
  * TG_HDL_RATIO: PCA ρ = 0.610, AE ρ = -0.055
  * ALT: PCA ρ = 0.195, AE ρ = -0.005

9. OUTPUTS
----------
- mdls_static.csv: MDLS per patient-window
- mdls_longitudinal.csv: Trajectory metrics (slope, stability, last MDLS)
- Model artifacts: Saved PCA and AE models
- Diagnostic plots: Distributions, loadings, trajectories

10. INTERPRETATION
------------------
Higher MDLS values indicate:
- Worsening metabolic coherence
- Increased dysregulation across multiple biomarker domains
- Potential need for closer monitoring

Lower MDLS values indicate:
- More favorable metabolic profile
- Better coherence across biomarkers
- Lower dysregulation signal

The score is continuous and should be interpreted in context of:
- Patient demographics
- Temporal trends (slope, stability)
- Clinical presentation

11. MAINTENANCE
--------------
- Models should be retrained periodically as data distribution shifts
- Monitor for distribution drift
- Validate on new data before deployment
- Update model card with new validation results
